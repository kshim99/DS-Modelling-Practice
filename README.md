# Data Science Modelling Practice

This repository is dedicated to practicing data science modelling in Python. The materials and resources used for this practice are sourced from the website [python.datasciencebook.ca](https://python.datasciencebook.ca/). It is recommeded to read and follow through the corresponding Chapters from the website before attempting the exercises.

## Notes:
The writers recommend using Binder to open up the exercises, I could not save my work this way. They recommend setting up Docker to ensure that the exercises are evaluated properly when running locally, but I noticed that most test cases pass regardless of using Docker. 

Setting up Docker on my windows was painful to say the least, and the particular image tag they suggest using does not work at all. Using the latest tag works, but still errors out on some test cases. 

Not using Docker and just running locally still passes most of the test cases. I verified the correctness of my answers that do not pass some test cases by running the same code on Binder which passed all test cases with flying colours.

My answers to the exercises can be used as an answer sheet if you don't want to perform the same task on Binder again for comparison.
